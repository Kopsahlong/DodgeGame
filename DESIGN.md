# Cave Dodge

Cave Dodge is a scrolling game with a shooting and non shooting mode.

### The Challenge
In Cave Dodge, an emoji is stuck in a cave and needs to get out. Sadly, there are stalagmites and stalagtites that make navigating the cave very dangerous. To get out, the emoji must make it's way through the cave while hitting no more than three of these objects.
- Level 1: *Scrolling, non shooting.* The emoji must simply avoid the objects.
- Level 2: *Scrolling and shooting.* Because the cave has become colder, ice barriers have now frozen between the stalagmites and stalagtites, which are also harmful to the emoji. Luckily, our emoji friend has found a gun somewhere inbetween Levels 1 & 2, and can now use it to break down the ice barriers.

### Overall Goal
To win the game, one must dodge 75 cave formations in Level 1, and 100 in Level 2, with a maximum hit count of 2 times per level.

### Basic Mechanics
Cave Dodge is a simple game to navigate. From the home screen one can choose a character, or go ahead and play either level. Starting from Level 1 will allow the user to play the game from start to finish. The <space> key can be used to skip a level description, and the <esc> key can be used to exit the game during play.
